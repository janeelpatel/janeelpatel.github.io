# [Personal Website](https://janeelpatel.github.io/)

This repository contains code for my personal website. The basic skeleton and the HTML and CSS framework of the site is provided by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) which has amazing, pre-styled templates which are absolutely free (under the Creative Commons License). The basic framework was customized and modified according to my own requirements.

Some content additions to the website are still to be done and are, as of now incomplete.
